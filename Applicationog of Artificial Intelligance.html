<h3>Virtual Agents</h3>
A virtual agent refers to a computer agent or a program that is capable of interacting effectively with humans. Trending on charts top 15 hot artificial intelligence technologies, currently, it is used in customer service through Chat bots as well as a smart home manager. Companies that provide virtual agents are Apple, Google, Amazon, Artificial Solutions, Assist AI, Creative Virtual, IBM, IPsoft, Microsoft and Satisfi. 


<h3>Decision Management</h3>
Artificially Intelligent machines have the capability of introducing logic to AI systems in order to gear them up to be used for training, maintenance and tuning. In order to add value to the business and profitable, decision management is already being used by organizations by incorporating it into their applications to propel and execute automated decision. Some companies that provide this service are Informatica, Advanced Systems Concepts, Maana, Pegasystems and UiPath. 



<h3>AI Optimized Hardware</h3>
Owing to better and improved graphics as well as central processing units, devices are being structured and used to execute AI oriented tasks specifically. A prominent example of this is the AI optimized silicon chip which can be inserted into any portable device. Therefore, companies and organizations are investing greatly in AI to accelerate the next generation of applications. This technological service is offered by companies like Alluviate, Google, Cray, Intel, IB and Nvidia. 


<h3>Deep Learning Platforms</h3>
Deep Learning Platforms is a form of machine Learning that duplicates the neural circuits of the human brain to process data and create patterns for decision making. In this unique technology, algorithms use artificial neural networks. A few of its applications are automated speech recognition, image recognition and prediction of anything that can be sensed in the digital sphere. Deep learning platform providers are Deep Instinct, Ersatz Labs, Fluid AI, MathWorks, Peltarion, Saffron Technology, Sentient Technologies and Leverton. 

So we have it halfway in this Top 15 Top Artificial Intelligence Technologies article, let us see some more tools.


<h3>Robotic Process Automation</h3>
Robotic Process Automation refers to the functioning of corporate processes due to the mimicking human tasks and automate them. In this particular sphere, it is important to bear in mind that AI is not meant to replace humans, but to support and complement their skills and talent. Companies like Pega systems, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, UiPath and WorkFusion focus on this process.

<h3>Bio-metrics</h3>
Bioetrics deals with the recognition, measurement and analysis of the physical features of the body’s structure, form and human behavior. It fosters organic interactions between machines and humans as it works with touch, image, speech and body language. It is predominantly used for the purpose of market research. #VR, Affectiva, Agnitio, FaceFirst, Sensory, Synqera and Tahzoo provide this technology service.



<h3>Cyber Defense</h3>
Cyber defense is a computer defense mechanism that aims to detect, prevent and mitigate attacks and threats to data and infrastructure of systems. Neural networks that are capable of processing sequences of inputs can be put to use along with machine learning techniques to create learning technologies in order to reveal suspicious user activity and detect cyber threats.


<h3>Content Creation</h3>
Although content is created by people working on videos, ads, blogs and white papers; brands like Hearst, USA Today ad CBS are using AI to generate  content. Wordsmith is a popular tool created by Automated Insights, which applies NLP in order to generate news stories.


<h3>Emotion Recognition</h3>
This kind of AI technology enables emotions expressed by humans to be read and interpreted using advanced image processing or audio data processing. Law enforcers often use thus technology during interrogation. Some companies who use emotion recognition are Beyond Verbal, nViso and Affectiva.



<h3>Image Recognition</h3>
Image recognition refers to the process of identifying and detecting a feature in a video or an image. It can help the process of image searches greatly as well as detect license plates, diagnose diseases and study personalities. Clarifai, SenseTime and GuGum’s provide this technology service.
